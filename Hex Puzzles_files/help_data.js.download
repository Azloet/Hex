This will help you learn the critical skill of evaluating positions; not just your own but your opponent&rsquo;s as well. Knowing the strengths and weaknesses of each player&rsquo;s position is key to spending your move most effectively. Another benefit of recognising connected patterns is that it can help you visualize your goal. When solving problems (or playing the game), it is very helpful to know connected patterns to work towards. In many cases you will find you only have to look a few moves ahead to find a shape that you know is connected."
